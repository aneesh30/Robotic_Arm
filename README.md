## Robotic_Arm_Using_Arduino
Designed and realized in the project, the robot arm has the ability to move in 4 axis directions with 4 servo motors.
In this you can take the desired material from one place and carry it to another place, and also mix it with the material it receives.
While doing this, robot control is provided by connecting to the android application.
